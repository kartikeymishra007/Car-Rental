<h2>Maruti Swift Dzire</h2>
<P>The Suzuki Dzire (stylized DZire, previously knows as the Suzuki Swift Sedan), known as the Suzuki Swift Sedan in Colombia and Guatemala, [1][2] is a subcompact notchback sedan made by Suzuki mainly for the Indian market since 2008.
    It was developed as a sedan variation of the Swift hatchback.
    The Dzire was launched in 2008 and was based on the first generation Swift hatchback. 
    It was introduced as a subcompact sedan for the Indian market in order to offer a sedan-like car in a smaller size.
   Later, in order to get the tax benefits offered to cars with a length below 4 meters in India, it was converted into a sub-4-meter sedan.</P>
