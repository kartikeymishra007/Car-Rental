<h2>ALTO K10</h2>
<P>The Maruti Suzuki Alto is a city car manufactured and marketed by Suzuki through its subsidiary Maruti Suzuki primarily for the Indian market since 2000. 
    The first-generation model was essentially the Indian version of the fifth-generation Suzuki Alto kei car (with larger engine options). 
    The second generation was made as a standalone model, which was built on the same platform as the first generation.
     The third-generation model is built on the same underpinnings as the S-Presso
     Since 2006, the Alto has been India's best-selling car[2] and crossed the 1 million production figure in February 2008 
     becoming the third Maruti model to cross the million mark in India after Maruti 800 and Maruti Omni and fourth overall joining Hyundai Santro.</P>
