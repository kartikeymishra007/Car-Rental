<h2>KIA SELTOS</h2>
<P>The Kia Seltos is a subcompact crossover SUV manufactured by Kia.
    Introduced in mid-2019, the Seltos is positioned between the smaller Stonic, Soul, or Sonet and the larger Sportage in Kia's global SUV lineup
    The Seltos is designated as a global product with three variations introduced for different markets.
    The first variation is the largest version of the Seltos, which is manufactured in South Korea (codename: SP2) mainly aimed at developed markets, including North America and Australasia.
     The two other variations are the Indian-made Seltos (codename: SP2i) and the closely related Chinese version badged as the Kia KX3 (codename: SP2c). The SP2i and SP2c models are the low-cost versions of the Seltos to penetrate emerging markets, built on the Hyundai-Kia K2 platform and closely related to the second-generation Hyundai Creta/ix25.
      Despite being a globally marketed model, the Seltos is not sold in the European market</P>
