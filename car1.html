<h2>Honda civic</h2>
<P>Hondaâ€™s Civic badge made a re-entry into the Indian market in March 2019. The Honda Civic makes a comeback after 7 years and it's the 10th generation that makes its way to India. Honda has given the all-new Civic major updates over its predecessors as far as performance and technology is concerned. The biggest USP of the new Honda Civic is that it now gets a diesel engine. The previous civic was a petrol-only model and lack of a diesel variant eventually lead to its elimination from Honda's India line-up. The design of the Civic has always been one of its core strengths and the 2019 Civic doesn't disappoint on that front either. 

    The new Honda Civic sedan gets a striking new design with a sharp front end characterised by an angular bumper and all-LED headlamps. The rear styling has completely transformed with the new C-shaped LED taillights and the fastback roofline that converges into the boot. The new Civic is a lovely looking car and definitely commands presence on road. The new Civic is shod with stylish dual tone 5-spoke 17-inch diamond-cut alloy wheels, sleek ORVMs and a shark-fin antenna completing the overall sharp look. The 2019 Honda Civic is equipped with a 7.0-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto compatibility. Other key features of the 2019 Honda Civic includes cruise control, 8-way adjustable driver's seat, electric sunroof, dual-zone climate control and smart key engine on and off feature. The instrument cluster is digital as well with a 7-inch unit, while you also get a push-button start system. On the feature front, the new Civic comes loaded with six airbags, ABS, EBD, Agile Handling Assist, stability control and hill start assist along with some segment first features like the lane watch camera assist and electric parking brake.
    
    The made-in-Thailand Honda Civic had received 5-Star safety rating in the ASEAN N-CAP. While the India spec model uses the same kits, we can only endorse it after our model goes through the crash test procedure. The New Honda Civic gets a 1.8-litre four-cylinder petrol motor that pumps out 139 bhp at 6,500 rpm and 174 Nm of peak torque available at 4,300 rpm. The new Civic also gets with a 1.6-litre i-DTEC diesel engine for the first time and pumps out 118 bhp at 4,000 rpm and 300 Nm of peak torque at 2,000 rpm. The petrol engine is only offered with a CVT unit, while the diesel gets a 6-speed manual transmission. Honda claims an ARAI certified fuel efficiency figure of 16.5 kmpl on the petrol and 26.8 kmpl on the diesel model.
